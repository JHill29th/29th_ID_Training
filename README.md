Below is still a work in progress...

## Installation & Setup 
	- To make it easier and save space only the 'mission.sqm' file is seperated into it's own folder inside the folder...
		- /29th_Training_Mission_Template 
	- All the contents of the '/29th_Training_Mission_Template/_Mission Files/' Folder needs to be copied into each mission folder beside 'mission.sqm' you want to use.
	- then Rename the mission folder and add to '29th_ID_Training.'	the name infront of the Map name.
		- example 1: /29th_Training_Mission_Template/Altis --> /29th_Training_Mission_Template/29th_Training.Altis
		- example 2: /29th_Training_Mission_Template/Zargabad --> /29th_Training_Mission_Template/29th_Training.Zargabad
