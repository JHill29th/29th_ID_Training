Below is still a work in progress...

## Installation & Setup 
- To make it easier and save space only the 'mission.sqm' file is seperated into it's own folder inside the folder...
  - `/29th_Training_Mission_Template` 
  - All the contents of the '/29th_Training_Mission_Template/_Mission Files/' folder needs to be copied into each mission folder beside 'mission.sqm' you want to use.
- Then, Rename the mission folder and add to '29th_ID_Training.' (the name infront of the Map name).
  - example 1: `/29th_Training_Mission_Template/Altis` --> `/29th_Training_Mission_Template/29th_Training.Altis`
  - example 2: `/29th_Training_Mission_Template/Zargabad` --> `/29th_Training_Mission_Template/29th_Training.Zargabad`
